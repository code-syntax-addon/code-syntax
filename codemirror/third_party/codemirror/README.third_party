Description:
A versatile text editor.
We only use the syntax-highlighting part of the project.

The file lib/codemirror.js was generated with `npm install` and copied to here.

The codemirror code assumes that it is executed in a browser and thus needs
a small shim to run.

mode/sql/sql.js is from different revision:
